# Stockfish-BitBoard

I want to play around with some Deep Neural Networks for a Chess AI heuristic and desided to dissect the bitboard and move generation functionality from the Stockfish source.

This is a work in progress. The current version works, but there are still things that can be trimmed from the Stockfish source for the afore mentioned purposes.

----------------------------------------

# TODO

1. Trim code further
2. add surface level API for NN integration simplicity
